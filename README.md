# Post-It-Note To-do-list

## A to-do-list program that utilizes post-it-notes and gives flexibility to divide tasks into separate sections.

This to-do-list program allows the user to create post it note sections at the starting dashboard, and multiple post-it-note to-do-lists can be created in each section. Each section can be given a title to categorize. The post-it-note to-do-lists contain the tasks and can contain a header to futher categorize tasks. Sections, to-do-lists, tasks, and the to-dio-list headers are also removable. This program gives control over the division of tasks, providing for flexibility in organization.
